# Config Investigation — kernel 6.18.24

Branch: `config-investigation-6.18`
Goal: Read `.config-6.18` end-to-end and produce a categorised list of options that are candidates for disabling, while keeping the 560Z's load-bearing subsystems (networking, sound, video, hard drive, USB) functional. Output is a reviewable markdown document that linic can use as input to a future `make menuconfig` slimming pass — no `.config` edits in this branch.

This file is the journal for that investigation, per the `TRY_YOUR_BEST_SHOT.md` protocol.

## Starting point

- Branch was forked from `cs4237b-clean-driver-wip` at commit `338381a` (`cs4237b: STATUS.md — compile succeeded, built-in findings`).
- `.config-6.18` is 3152 lines, 945 `CONFIG_*` lines: 865 `=y`, 2 `=m`, 78 numeric/string, 1373 `# ... is not set`. Mostly built-in; very few modules.
- Current release baseline (`release/6.18.24.17.2/`): `bzImage` 3.8 MiB, `core.gz` 3.7 MiB.
- 560Z hardware envelope (from `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, prior memory):
  - Pentium II (MMX, no SSE/SSE2/AVX); ~64 MB RAM; Intel 430TX chipset.
  - ISA + PCI; CS4237B (ISA PnP) sound; PCMCIA/CardBus; USB 1.x UHCI (PIIX4).
  - IDE/ATA hard drive (no SATA, no NVMe, no SCSI hardware).
  - On-board video — NeoMagic NM2160 (assumption, to confirm if it matters for the investigation).
  - Networking is **always external**: USB→Ethernet (Realtek 8152), or USB/PCMCIA wifi (`rtl8192cu` mentioned in README).
- Kernel build is overwhelmingly `=y` (built-in), so anything disabled here goes straight to bzImage size, not module size. Disabling a `# is not set` line has no effect — it is already off.

## Plan

Phased — each phase ends with one commit appending findings to this journal (or a sibling file under `journal/`). Lowest risk first.

- [x] Phase 0 — Journal scaffold. Commit this file. (this commit)
- [ ] Phase 1 — Inventory pass. Read `.config-6.18` end-to-end. Tag every `=y` against a category (cpu/platform, memory, fs, net, sound, video, hdd, usb, debug, crypto, security, misc) in `journal/CONFIG_INVENTORY_6.18.md`. No "disable/keep" judgments yet — just classification.
- [ ] Phase 2 — Architectural defaults. Identify `=y` options that are mismatched with 560Z hardware (e.g. SMP, NUMA, modern x86 features, virtualisation guest/host code, large-page support, big-iron NICs, RAID, NVMe, SCSI, modern wireless stacks). High-confidence "disable" candidates.
- [ ] Phase 3 — Subsystem keep-lists. For each of the five must-keep subsystems (networking, sound, video, hdd, usb), list the symbols that are load-bearing and must NOT be disabled. Cross-reference Phase 2 to make sure none of those candidates accidentally killed something needed.
- [ ] Phase 4 — Debug / instrumentation / tracing. Kernels carry a lot of debug surface (`CONFIG_DEBUG_*`, `CONFIG_FTRACE`, `CONFIG_KPROBES`, `CONFIG_BPF*`). Catalogue what's enabled and what is candidate-for-disable on a tight-RAM box.
- [ ] Phase 5 — Crypto / security / namespaces / cgroups. Things that container-y distros leave on by default but that a single-user 560Z almost certainly does not need.
- [ ] Phase 6 — Filesystems beyond what TCL actually mounts. TCL is squashfs + tmpfs + ext4-ish; many other FS drivers may be `=y`.
- [ ] Phase 7 — Synthesis. Produce `journal/CONFIG_DISABLE_CANDIDATES_6.18.md` — three buckets: `safe-to-disable`, `probably-safe-verify`, `keep`. Each candidate has a one-line reason.
- [ ] Phase 8 — Close-out. Final journal entry, list of open questions for linic, things explicitly out of scope.

## Log

- 2026-04-28 — Phase 0: branch `config-investigation-6.18` created off `cs4237b-clean-driver-wip`. Journal scaffold committed. No `.config` changes in this branch.

## Clarifying questions for linic

Numbered so you can reply "Q3: option b" without ambiguity. Best guess included so the AI can default if you don't get to it before the usage window closes.

**Q1.** Is the goal "smaller bzImage on disk" (boot media space), or "less RAM at runtime" (more headroom for `init`), or both? They overlap heavily but not perfectly — e.g. trimming `=m` modules saves disk but not boot-time RAM, while trimming `=y` saves both.
- Best guess: **both, with runtime RAM as the primary motivation** (the README explicitly says the 560Z hits init-OOM on stock TCL).

**Q2.** "Video" on the must-keep list — does that mean *framebuffer console + Xorg-able display* (i.e. the 560Z can run the desktop the way `tools/desktop.sh` expects), or just text console? They imply different keep-sets (DRM/fbdev/efifb vs. just VGA/VT).
- Best guess: **framebuffer console + whatever Xorg's `vesa`/generic driver needs**. No KMS/DRM hard requirement on a NeoMagic chip from 1998.

**Q3.** "Networking" — must we keep both the on-PCMCIA-card wireless path *and* the USB-Ethernet path? Or is USB-Ethernet the only really-supported path now and PCMCIA wireless is a nice-to-have?
- Best guess: **keep both for now**, since `rtl8192cu` and PCMCIA show up in `tools/` scripts and existing `*-modules-*.tcz` artifacts. Mark PCMCIA wireless as a candidate to revisit if we need to claw back more space later.

**Q4.** Are you OK with this investigation producing **only** a markdown report (no `.config` edits, no menuconfig session, no rebuild)? The TRY_YOUR_BEST_SHOT framing suggests yes, but I want to confirm before I leave a branch with zero `.config` deltas.
- Best guess: **yes, report-only is the deliverable for this branch**; the actual `.config` edit lives in a future branch where you can drive `make menuconfig` interactively.

**Q5.** For Phase 5 (security/namespaces/cgroups): TinyCore *itself* doesn't use namespaces or cgroups, but `extensions` you load might (e.g. some Docker-ish extensions). Should I treat namespaces/cgroups as "safe to disable" or "verify with what extensions you actually use"?
- Best guess: **safe to disable on a 560Z** — you've never mentioned running containerised workloads on the 560Z, and the RAM budget would not allow it anyway.

## Decisions made without input (record of assumptions)

(Empty so far. Each unilateral call lands here as the analysis proceeds, with a one-line reason and a note on reversibility.)

## Things out of scope / left alone

- No `.config-6.18` edits in this branch. Edits happen in a future branch via `make menuconfig`.
- No rebuild / no boot test — those need the 560Z and are out of this session's scope anyway.
- No changes to `cs4237b/`, the trim pipeline, or any tools.
- `.config-4`, `.config-5`, `.config-6` are not analysed. The 6.18 line is the live one; older lines are kept for historical comparison only.
- No analysis of which `=m` modules to drop from the `*-modules-*.tcz` packaging. That's a separate problem (disk size of `.tcz`, not bzImage size).
